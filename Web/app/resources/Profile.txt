I am a Third-Year student at U of T, completing Civil Engineering with a Business Minor. I have a diverse range of experience, ranging from programming to summer camp to music. I am looking to use my education in Civil Engineering and combine that with my computer competence and my skills in facilitation and collaboration gained from camp. Working at summer camp gave me an appreciation for a tight knit community, and I hope to find that in my future employment.
