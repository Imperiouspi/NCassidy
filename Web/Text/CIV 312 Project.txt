Five group members and I collaborated to design a five storey steel structure, seen in figure 1. I modelled the structure using <a>S-frame</a>, and everyone designed three seperate members. Designing three members required using the CISC steel handbook. This can be a tedious process of iteration, so I and one other member, created the excel spreadsheet (attached above), to facilitate this process. The user can input the properties of the section they wish to test, and it will check whether that section can support the limit states experienced by that beam.
